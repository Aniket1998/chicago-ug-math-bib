## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

There is a set of math topics which used to be thought of as covering the first two years of an
undergraduate curriculum in any quantitative discipline. Roughly speaking these are calculus of
one and several variables, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations. Depending on
the specific discipline you might throw in the basics of Fourier analysis, or a bit of
statistics, but fundamentally calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations are what you
have to have.

Nowadays it's common for strong students to arrive at university with most or all of this from
high school, or maybe calculus and some other enrichment topics. And linear algebra and
differential equations are so often _taught_ with an applied and computational bias, because
that's what students outside pure math need, that pure math students and teachers might ignore
these topics, or hand-wave them away as "something you can pick up in a few weeks when you need
to". It's entirely possible to emerge from a strong undergraduate program in pure mathematics
almost completely ignorant of what the eigenvalues of a matrix are good for, or how to solve
even the simplest differential equation. I know, because I did!

But these topics _are_ foundational, and I wish I had learned them better when I had the
chance. Having applications doesn't magically make a piece of math boring, and it doesn't mean
you have to approach it as an unmotivated cookbook of procedures to memorize.

## <a name="calculus-one"></a> Calculus of one variable

Of course, as we all know, the One True Calculus Book is

#### Spivak, *Calculus*

This is a book everyone should read.  If you don't know calculus and have the time, read it and
do all the exercises.  Parts 1 and 2 are where I finally learned what a limit was, after three
years of bad-calculus-book "explanations".  The whole thing is the most coherently envisioned
and explained treatment of one-variable calculus I've seen (you can see throughout that Spivak
*has a vision* of what he's trying to teach).

The book has flaws, of course.  The exercises get a little monotonous because Spivak has a few
tricks he likes to use repeatedly, and perhaps too few of them deal with applications (but you
can find that kind of exercise in any book).  Also, he sometimes avoids sophistication at the
expense of clarity, as in the proofs of Three Hard Theorems in chapter 8 (where a lot of
epsilon-pushing takes the place of the words "compact" and "connected").  Nevertheless, this is
the best calculus book overall, and I've seen it do a wonderful job of brain rectification on
many people.

**[Pete Clark]** Yes, it's good, although perhaps more of the affection comes from more
advanced students who flip back through it?  Most of my exposure to this book comes from
tutoring and grading for 161, but I seriously believe that working as many problems as possible
(it must be acknowledged that many of them are difficult for first year students, and a few of
them are *really* hard!) is invaluable for developing the mathematical maturity and epsilonic
technique that no math major should be without.
