# Intermediate - Foundations

#### Halmos, *Naive set theory*

[MR 56 #11794](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=56+%2311794)

The best book for a first encounter with "real" set theory.  Like everything Paul Halmos
writes, it's stylistically beautiful.  A very skinny book, broken into very short sections,
each dealing with a narrow topic and with an exercise or three.  It requires just a little
sophistication, but no great experience with "real" math; we use this one for YSP kids
sometimes too.

#### Fraenkel, *Abstract set theory*

[MR 33 #5442](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=33+%235442)

Fraenkel was the F in ZFC, and he gives a suitably rigorous development of set theory from an
axiomatic viewpoint.  Unfortunately, for the philosophical foundations of the axioms he refers
to another book (Fraenkel and Bar-Hillel, *Foundations of set theory*
[MR 49 #10546](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=49+%2310546)), which is missing from
Eckhart Library.  Good for culture.

#### Kunen, *Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Results*

**[Noah Schoem]**

[MR 2905394](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2905394)

Advanced undergraduate introduction to the core questions, principles, and tools of modern set theory. As such, the text builds up to deciding what *cannot* be proven using ZFC alone (including the Continuum Hypothesis). 
Despite the advanced matter, Kunen is about as clear and accessible introduction to such an abstract subject as possible. That said, I would recommend reading Ebbinghaus/Flum/Thomas or Enderton before reading Kunen, simply because Kunen writes chapter I as a quick review of syntax, rather than a deep exposition.

Chapter II covers odd combinatorial results in set theory, and can reasonably be skipped by the uninterested until needed.

Chapters III-VIII cover the core of modern set theory, with Chapters III and IV covering the basics, V and VI covering the Constructible Universe L (the foundations of inner model theory), and VII and VIII covering Forcing (and the consistency of the failure of the Continuum Hypothesis). 

I recommend reading Chapters I, III, and IV for anyone interested in the general foundations of set theory. The chapters on L and Forcing will be of more interest to pure set theorists; for intermediate undergraduate study in pure set theory, I would recommend Chapters V - VII; chapter VIII on iterated forcing is better suited to advanced study.

#### Ebbinghaus/Flum/Thomas, *Mathematical logic*

[MR 95e:03002](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=95e%3A03002)

The only logic book I can name off the top of my head, this is the 277 book.  I found it
readable but boringly syntactic (well, maybe that's elementary logic).

#### Enderton, *A mathematical introduction to logic*

[MR 49 #2239](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=49+%232239)

Look, another logic book!  This one might be preferable just because there's much more talking
about what's going on and less unmotivated symbol-pushing than in E/F/T.  The flip side of that
is, the constructions may or may not be epsilon less precise.  I'm not a logician; if you are,
write some reviews so I can replace these lousy ones!

#### Chang & Keisler, *Model Theory*

**[Noah Schoem]**

[MR 0532927](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0532927)

Standard graduate introduction to model theory; Math 277 sometimes teaches the basics of formal logic and model theory (i.e. Completeness, Compactness, and LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem) from the first two chapters. Heavily covers ultrapowers and saturation, which is interesting material, but forms only a small part of model theory and isn't a major focus of active research.

#### Landau, *Foundations of analysis*

[MR 12,397m](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=12%2C397m)

This is the book that invented the infamous Landau *"Satz-Beweis"* (theorem-proof) style.
There is *nothing* in this book except the inexorable progression of theorems and proofs, which
is perhaps appropriate for a construction of the real numbers from nothing, but makes horrible
bathroom reading.  Read for culture.
