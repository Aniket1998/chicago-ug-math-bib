# Intermediate - Foundations

#### Halmos, *Naive set theory*

[MR 56 #11794](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=56+%2311794)

The best book for a first encounter with "real" set theory.  Like everything Paul Halmos
writes, it's stylistically beautiful.  A very skinny book, broken into very short sections,
each dealing with a narrow topic and with an exercise or three.  It requires just a little
sophistication, but no great experience with "real" math; we use this one for YSP kids
sometimes too.

#### Fraenkel, *Abstract set theory*

[MR 33 #5442](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=33+%235442)

Fraenkel was the F in ZFC, and he gives a suitably rigorous development of set theory from an
axiomatic viewpoint.  Unfortunately, for the philosophical foundations of the axioms he refers
to another book (Fraenkel and Bar-Hillel, *Foundations of set theory*
[MR 49 #10546](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=49+%2310546)), which is missing from
Eckhart Library.  Good for culture.

#### Kunen, *Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Results*

**[Noah Schoem]**

[MR 2905394](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2905394)

Advanced undergraduate introduction to the core questions, principles, and tools of modern set theory. 
Kunen's text develops the foundations of set theory, beginning with the axioms of and motivation for ZFC and a fast review of formal logic. 
Kunen then covers some basic consistency proofs. 
The text continues to the Constructible Universe L, some basic inner model theory, and the consistency of the Continuum Hypothesis, 
and concludes with the method of Forcing, Iterated Forcing, the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis, and the consistency of Martin's Axiom. 
The later chapters are quite difficult, but fundamental to modern set theory.

#### Ebbinghaus/Flum/Thomas, *Mathematical logic*

[MR 95e:03002](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=95e%3A03002)

The only logic book I can name off the top of my head, this is the 277 book.  I found it
readable but boringly syntactic (well, maybe that's elementary logic).

#### Enderton, *A mathematical introduction to logic*

[MR 49 #2239](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=49+%232239)

Look, another logic book!  This one might be preferable just because there's much more talking
about what's going on and less unmotivated symbol-pushing than in E/F/T.  The flip side of that
is, the constructions may or may not be epsilon less precise.  I'm not a logician; if you are,
write some reviews so I can replace these lousy ones!

#### Landau, *Foundations of analysis*

[MR 12,397m](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=12%2C397m)

This is the book that invented the infamous Landau *"Satz-Beweis"* (theorem-proof) style.
There is *nothing* in this book except the inexorable progression of theorems and proofs, which
is perhaps appropriate for a construction of the real numbers from nothing, but makes horrible
bathroom reading.  Read for culture.
