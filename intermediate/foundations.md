# Intermediate - Foundations

#### Halmos, *Naive set theory*

[MR 56 #11794](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=56+%2311794)

The best book for a first encounter with "real" set theory.  Like everything Paul Halmos
writes, it's stylistically beautiful.  A very skinny book, broken into very short sections,
each dealing with a narrow topic and with an exercise or three.  It requires just a little
sophistication, but no great experience with "real" math; we use this one for YSP kids
sometimes too.

#### Fraenkel, *Abstract set theory*

[MR 33 #5442](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=33+%235442)

Fraenkel was the F in ZFC, and he gives a suitably rigorous development of set theory from an
axiomatic viewpoint.  Unfortunately, for the philosophical foundations of the axioms he refers
to another book (Fraenkel and Bar-Hillel, *Foundations of set theory*
[MR 49 #10546](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=49+%2310546)), which is missing from
Eckhart Library.  Good for culture.

#### Ebbinghaus/Flum/Thomas, *Mathematical logic*

[MR 95e:03002](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=95e%3A03002)

The only logic book I can name off the top of my head, this is the 277 book.  I found it
readable but boringly syntactic (well, maybe that's elementary logic).

#### Enderton, *A mathematical introduction to logic*

[MR 49 #2239](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=49+%232239)

Look, another logic book!  This one might be preferable just because there's much more talking
about what's going on and less unmotivated symbol-pushing than in E/F/T.  The flip side of that
is, the constructions may or may not be epsilon less precise.  I'm not a logician; if you are,
write some reviews so I can replace these lousy ones!

#### Landau, *Foundations of analysis*

[MR 12,397m](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=12%2C397m)

This is the book that invented the infamous Landau *"Satz-Beweis"* (theorem-proof) style.
There is *nothing* in this book except the inexorable progression of theorems and proofs, which
is perhaps appropriate for a construction of the real numbers from nothing, but makes horrible
bathroom reading.  Read for culture.
