# Intermediate - Advanced or multivariable calculus

#### Spivak, *Calculus on manifolds*

[MR 35 #309](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=35+%23309)

This is the book everybody gets in differentiation and integration in R^n, and it's a pretty
good one, although the integration chapters are hard to read--maybe it was just my first
encounter with exterior algebra that made it hard.  As usual for Spivak books, clear exposition
and lots of nice exercises.  Unfortunately this one is old enough to be annoyingly typeset.

**[Pete Clark]** I don't really like this book, and I'm a big fan of Spivak in general.  Does
anybody else think that this rigorous multivariable Riemann integral theory is a dinosaur?  And
when Spivak starts talking about chains (in chapter four, I think), I don't know what the hell
he's talking about.  Presumably you could ignore that chapter and use the book as an
introduction to differential forms.  I can't suggest a substitute at the moment, other than
Spivak's *Comprehensive introduction* volume 1, which is a wonderful book but which I still
wouldn't want to read as a first introduction to forms.  Come to think of it, I love forms to
death, but maybe they're just plain confusing the first time around...

#### do Carmo, *Differential forms and applications*

[MR 95j:58002](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=95j%3A58002)

This skinny yellow book has replaced Munkres's *Analysis on manifolds*
[MR 92d:58001](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=92d%3A58001) as the text for 274, and
I'm not sure it's an improvement.  It's more like a modernized *Calculus on manifolds*.  I
haven't done more than glance through it, but the notation is reputedly horrible, and Spivak is
definitely a superior expositor.
