# Intermediate - Combinatorics and discrete mathematics

#### Graham/Knuth/Patashnik, *Concrete mathematics*

[MR 97d:68003](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=97d%3A68003)

The first chapter of Knuth's immortal work *The art of computer programming* is an extensive
study of combinatorics and asymptotics.  G/K/P is an expanded and friendlier version, which
emphasizes teaching the reader to solve things, rather than just showing how they are done.
Contains many funny marginal notes from students in the Stanford class which gave birth to the
book, as well as tons of great exercises.  Not a reference work.
