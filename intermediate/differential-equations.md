# Intermediate - Differential equations

#### Arnold, *Ordinary differential equations*

[MR 93b:34001](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=93b%3A34001)

Yes, Virginia, there is an interesting geometric theory of differential equations (of course!),
not just the stuff you see in those engineering texts: stuff about stable and unstable points
or manifolds, and other things with a dynamical-systems flavor.  Nevertheless there is
substantial material on how to reduce a differential equation to linear form and solve it,
although no Laplace transform techniques or the like.  Arnold explains it all coherently at an
advanced-calculus level (manifolds appear at the end), complete with many beautiful diagrams.
Another distinctively Russian book--read all the ones I describe that way, and you'll see what
I mean.  The third edition is substantially different from the second (which I have): the
manifolds material is much expanded, and the typesetting is not so nice.

#### Hurewicz, *Lectures on ordinary differential equations*

[MR 91k:34001](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=91k%3A34001)

A tiny book which covers material similar to Arnold, but more concisely.  I haven't read it but
it's frequently referenced, and worth a look if you need to know the basic theorems.  (If all
you need is the basic existence-uniqueness theorem for ODEs, it's also in Spivak volume 1 or
Lang, *Real and functional analysis*.)
