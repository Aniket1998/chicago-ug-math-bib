# Intermediate - Classical geometry

#### Coxeter, *Introduction to geometry*

[MR 90a:51001](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=90a%3A51001)

This is an interesting book which I can't really describe.  It contains a number of short
treatments of undeniably geometric but nontraditional topics; one fascinating application is
the relation between phyllotaxis (the arrangement of plants' leaves around the stem) and
generalized Fibonacci-type numbers.  Read for culture.

#### Hilbert, *Foundations of geometry*

[MR 43 #1019](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=43+%231019)

Hilbert was very interested in finding coherent, minimal axiom systems for parts of
mathematics; he was probably inspired by the long debate over Euclid's parallel postulate and
the discovery in the late 19th century of consistent non-Euclidean geometries.  (The GÃ¶del
incompleteness theorems solved negatively one of Hilbert's famous problems.)  In this book
Hilbert described a correct and complete axiom system for Euclidean geometry, with the
dependence relations between axioms exhaustively determined, and then carefully derived most of
Euclid from it.  It's not a particularly fun read but its existence is philosophically
interesting.

#### Hartshorne, *Geometry: Euclid and beyond*

[MR 2001h:51001](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2001h%3A51001)

The algebraic geometer of the famed book from hell (see below) recently finished another
modern-Euclid book.  It's a sophisticated modern explication for a guided reading of much of
Euclid's *Elements*.  Very neat.
