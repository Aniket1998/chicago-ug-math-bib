# Elementary - Foundations

#### Rucker, *Infinity and the mind*

**[RV]** This is not really a math book.  It is a friendly introduction to the concept of
infinity, transfinite numbers, and related paradoxes.  I'd recommend it to high school students
who are intrested in math, but not quite ready to sit down and read though proof after proof of
theorems. (In fact, I first read it in high school as part of an independent study math class.)
The book does contain some proofs, but not in the rigorous form of a standard math text. It
does include more historical background on the concepts than most math texts do, which is
nice. Each chapter is accompanied by problems, and an answer key (with explanations) is at the
end of the book.
