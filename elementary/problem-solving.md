# Elementary - Problem-solving

#### NML problem books

The MAA publishes a series called "New Mathematical Library" which contains many excellent
titles aimed at or below college sophomore level (*Geometry revisited* is among them).  In this
series are four books of problems given on the AHSME, one of USAMO and two of IMO problems, all
with solutions.  We use the AHSME books extensively at YSP; the USAMO and IMO problems still
give me a rough time, and are fun if you're looking for frustration one evening.

#### Larson, *Problem solving through problems*

After you grapple with the IMO problems for a while, turn here to find a book that teaches (as
much as any book can) the art of solving them.  Cognitive strategies are laid out with examples
of problems (mostly from Olympiads and Putnams) to which they apply.

**[Pete Clark]** I own this, or at least I did -- I haven't seen it since high school.  I'm
*really not* a big contest problem-solver, but I did use this book and I think it helped to
*prepare me for Chicago Mathematics.  Lots of good problems, not all of them inane.

#### P贸lya, *How to solve it*

I haven't read this, but it's supposed to be the "classic" version of Larson above.

#### P贸lya, *Mathematics and plausible reasoning*, I and II

**[Pete Clark]** These are the "sequels" to P贸lya's *How to solve it*.  They are definitely
interesting, although their main interest may be psychological/philosophical (only relative to
mathematics do philosophy and psychology merge!)  I'm not sure that one can really become a
significantly better problem-solver by reading a book about the nature of mathematical
reasoning, but I admire P贸lya for writing an interesting and challenging book about the
*practice* of mathematics; such books are in my opinion too few and far between.

In 1997-98 a few books with the same general theme as Larson, but different problem
collections, have been published; I haven't seen any of them.
