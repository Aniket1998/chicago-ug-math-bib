#### Euclid, *The elements*

[MR 17,814b](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=17%2C814b)

No, I'm not kidding.  At first it's incredibly annoying and tedious to read, but after a while
you get into the flow of the language and the style.  Euclid teaches you both the power of the
modern algebraic methods and the things that are hidden by our instinct to assign a *number* to
a length.  Besides, there are wonderful tidbits here and there (did you know that Euclid
invented the Dedekind cut?).  At least check it out once, to read his proof of the Pythagorean
theorem.  (Thanks to Jonathan Beere ('95) for convincing me it was worthwhile.)

**[Pete Clark]** I have Volume I, and I have to admit I haven't really read it.  I do think
that I would benefit if someone rammed some of it down my throat though, because nowadays we
undergraduates are trained to regard "geometric" as a strong pejorative&mdash;the very
antithesis of rigor and proof.

#### Coxeter, *Geometry revisited*

This is a text on "advanced Euclidean geometry", starting with the numberless classical
"centers" of a triangle and proceeding from there.  Many good exercises.  There are lots of
"college geometry" texts you can find this stuff in, but most of them are aimed at math-ed
majors; this book and Coxeter's other one (see below) have them all beat.

**[Pete Clark]** I like this book.  I don't own it but I've flipped through it more than once
and I agree that it has a pleasantly non-brain-dead quality to it.  There are interesting
geometric facts that you probably haven't seen before in here.
