# Advanced - Problem solving

#### Pólya/Szegö, *Problems and theorems in analysis* I and II

These are very old books of very good problems, mostly from analysis, with complete solutions.
They're old-fashioned of course, but the polite word is "classical"; worth reading for culture,
to prepare for your quals, or (important!) to see if you can still do concrete calculations
after four years of brainwashing by abstraction.  (Anyone want to compute the n-Hausdorff
measure of S^n in R^(n+1)?)
