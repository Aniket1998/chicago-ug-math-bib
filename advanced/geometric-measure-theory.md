# Advanced - Geometric measure theory

#### Morgan, *Geometric measure theory: a beginner's guide*

#### Mattila, *Geometry of sets and measures on Euclidean spaces*

#### Federer, *Geometric measure theory*

Okay, so it's a little overkill, but I *like* geometric measure theory.  Here are three books
about it, two you should consider reading and one you should consider *not* reading.  Morgan
truly is a beginner's guide, and one of the best I've seen to any subject.  He introduces the
formidable technical apparatus of geometric measure theory bit by bit, leaning on pictures and
examples to show what it's for and why we work so hard.  Proofs of hard theorems are frequently
omitted (mostly referred to Federer).  Mattila is a recent book on the theory of
rectifiability, and looks good from the little I've seen.  Federer is the bible, and it's the
densest book I've ever seen, on anything.  Everything up to 1969 is in here, and much afterward
is anticipated.  In addition to the theory of rectifiable sets, Federer develops a powerful
homological integration theory, leading to a homology theory for locally Lipschitz sets and
maps in R^n which is isomorphic on nice sets to the usual homology theories.  You can't really
learn from it, except that sometimes you have to: the subject is itself very complicated and
there are few expositions.

#### Falconer, *The geometry of fractal sets*

Here is an exposition of the rudiments of geometric measure theory, mostly Hausdorff measures,
together with applications to rectifiability and regularity of sets of ugly dimension.  A nice
little book if you're curious about why it's a cool subject.
