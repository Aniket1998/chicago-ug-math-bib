# Advanced - Measure theory

#### Halmos, *Measure theory*

This was the standard reference for at least two generations of analysts, and it probably still
is, because nobody writes books entitled *Measure theory* any more.  Basically it's an abstract
analysis text with extra care paid to set-theoretic questions, regularity problems for
measures, and a construction of Haar measure.  It's a good book, since Paul Halmos wrote it,
but it might be considered old-fashioned now.  (For a more modern, emphatically
measure-theoretic analysis text, check out Bruckner/Bruckner/Thomson, *Real analysis*.)

#### Federer, *Geometric measure theory*

Federer's book is listed here because in the last few months, to my great surprise, it has
become my reference of choice for basic real analysis (replacing the first half of big Rudin).
Chapter 2 (of 5) is entitled "General measure theory", and it covers chapters 1-3 and 6-8 of
big Rudin in the space of eighty pages, together with tons of additional material on
group-invariant measures, covering theorems, and all the geometric measures (Hausdorff et al).
The presentation is compressed to within epsilon of unreadability, but once you unravel it, it
has a powerful elegance.  Federer takes great care to give the limits of generality in which
each result is true.  There are no exercises, but reading the book is hard exercise enough.  My
one quibble is that even big-name theorems are referenced by number; I would far prefer "by the
dominated convergence theorem" to "by 2.3.13" for the rest of the book.  If you don't like
reading dense books, stay far, far away from Federer, but if you want a complete, powerful
reference to measure theory, give it a try.
