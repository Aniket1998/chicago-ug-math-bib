Advanced - General abstract algebra

#### Jacobson, *Basic algebra* II

This is perhaps the only really advanced general-algebra book; it contains chapters on
categories, universal algebra, modules and module categories, classical ring theory,
representations of finite groups, homological algebra, commutative algebra, advanced field
theory...  Readability is uniformly low (unless you really like Jacobson's prose style) and the
quality ("sanity") of the treatments varies; I'd look anywhere else for group representation
theory, but as Jacobson is a ring theorist, the structure theory of rings and fields is
definitive.  (Not the commutative ring stuff though!)  I bought it before I really knew whether
it was worth having; now I'm not sure, but it's come in handy at surprising times.  Of dubious
use as a reference, since each chapter is woven rather tightly and he frequently refers to hard
results from volume I.
