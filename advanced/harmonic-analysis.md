# Advanced - Harmonic analysis

#### Katznelson, *An introduction to harmonic analysis*

And he means *analysis*... This is a short text on classical harmonic analysis, cheap and
pretty readable.  There's a rather perfunctory treatment of locally compact groups at the end,
but the real emphasis is on the classical theory of Fourier series and integrals, including all
kinds of sticky convergence and summation questions.

#### Rudin, *Fourier analysis on groups*

This is a classic text on commutative harmonic analysis (that is, on locally compact *abelian*
groups).  It's a fairly dense research monograph.

#### Hewitt/Ross, *Abstract harmonic analysis*

H/R is the Dunford/Schwartz of harmonic analysis; this is an immense two-volume set which
spends most of a first volume just setting up the generalities on topological groups and
integration theory.  As such, the recommendation is similar: look at it for culture.

#### Stein/Weiss, *Introduction to Fourier analysis on Euclidean spaces*

You might think of this as a more advanced Katznelson; it requires a pretty solid comfort with
first-year graduate analysis to read.

#### Helgason, *Groups and geometric analysis*

I found this a fascinating book.  At the risk of totally missing the point I might characterize
it as the differential-geometric side of noncommutative harmonic analysis (infinite-dimensional
representation theory of nonabelian groups).  It's about the geometric objects which arise from
invariance under symmetries of an ambient space (e.g., the Laplacian is the only
isometry-invariant differential operator on the plane).  Maybe someday I will actually be able
to read it; Helgason's earlier book (below) is a sufficient preparation.
