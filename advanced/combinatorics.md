# Advanced - Combinatorics and discrete mathematics

#### Lovasz, *Problems in combinatorics*

**[Pete Storm]** You simply must include what Hungarian mathematicians consider the most
important math book ever, Laszlo Lovasz's huge tome covering combinatorics from an elementary
level to Ph.D. level in one book.  It teaches combinatorics the way Hungarians think it should
be taught, by doing lots of problems.  The problems are very hard, but in the book there are
separate sections for problems, hints (which are often quite helpful), and full solutions.
Every budding young Hungarian combinatorist spends a year doing every problem in this book
sometime before he finishes his Ph.D.  As a side treat, the questions are often filled with
bits of Hungarian culture, e.g. "How many ways can you pass out *k* forints to *n* friends if 1
friend only wants an even number of forints and the rest of them must get at least one?" or
"Bela wants to buy flowers for his friend..." Probably the main thing wrong with this book is
it's horribly expensive unless you buy it in Hungary, where it's still $60.  If you can't find
this book in Eckhart, then maybe it's not so important to include it.  On the other hand, Babai
did help write it, so it is relevant nonetheless.

**[Chris Jeris]** A forint is about half a cent these days.

#### Stanley, *Enumerative combinatorics* I

Combinatorics is maturing from a collection of problems knit together by ad hoc methods (or
methods which appear ad hoc to non-combinatorists) into a discipline which is taught and
learned systematically.  Stanley's book got a rave review in the Bulletin of the AMS as the new
standard reference on counting, which really means most of combinatorics; I haven't read it but
I've seen it on a whole lot of grad students' shelves.  Try it out if G/K/P (above) is too
talky for you.  The second volume is now out.

#### Bollobás, *Modern graph theory*

This recent Springer GTM is a substantial revision and expansion of Bollobás's earlier graph
theory text.  Although I'm not a combinatorist by any stretch of the imagination, it looks like
a good book, inviting but not toy.
