# Advanced - Foundations

#### Mac Lane, *Categories for the working mathematician*

Pete Clark isn't convinced that the working mathematician needs any category theory at all, but
I definitely am!  Of course it depends on whether you're interested in something heavily
homological, but most people will need at least the basics of adjoints and limits sometime.
The book covers substantially more than that, but because examples are drawn from some advanced
stuff (rings and Lie algebras appear in the first chapter) you need a fair amount of background
to read it.  Noteworthy is a section near the end entitled "All concepts are Kan extensions".
Most books on homological algebra will contain a brief summary of category theory, as does
Jacobson's *Basic algebra* II; here you can find it laid out in more detail.
