# Advanced - Foundations

#### Mac Lane, *Categories for the working mathematician*

Pete Clark isn't convinced that the working mathematician needs any category theory at all, but
I definitely am!  Of course it depends on whether you're interested in something heavily
homological, but most people will need at least the basics of adjoints and limits sometime.
The book covers substantially more than that, but because examples are drawn from some advanced
stuff (rings and Lie algebras appear in the first chapter) you need a fair amount of background
to read it.  Noteworthy is a section near the end entitled "All concepts are Kan extensions".
Most books on homological algebra will contain a brief summary of category theory, as does
Jacobson's *Basic algebra* II; here you can find it laid out in more detail.

#### Jech, *Set Theory*

[MR 1940513](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1940513)

Spanning several hundred pages, Jech is the standard graduate-level teaching tool and reference text for set theory. Recommended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students planning to conduct research. 

This book has 38 chapters divided into 3 sections: 
  * Basic Set Theory: basics of the axioms, ordinals, cardinals, stationary sets, Boolean algebras, some combinatorial set theory and large cardinals, basic Descriptive set Theory, and basics of models of set theory
  * Advanced Set Theory: The Constructible Universe, Forcing, Iteration Forcing, More on Large Cardinals, Large Cardinals and Inner Model Theory, Descriptive Set Theory
  * Additional Topics

This text takes years to read. Consequently, most newly minted set theory PhDs have not read the entire work. However, an ambitious undergraduate could very well expand their set-theoretic knowledge by reading and solving exercises in the first six chapters.

#### Foreman, Kanamori, et al, *Handbook of Set Theory*

[MR 2768678](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2768678)

This three-volume collection spanning over 2000 pages is the de facto reference compendium for modern set theory. 
This text is meant for the professional researcher. PhD students (like me) spend weeks understanding offhand remarks and lone paragraphs in here.

#### Chang & Kiesler, *Model Theory*

**[Noah Schoem]**

[MR 0532927](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=0532927)

Standard graduate introduction to model theory; Math 277 sometimes teaches the basics of formal logic and model theory (i.e. Completeness, Compactness, and LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem) from the first two chapters. Heavily covers ultrapowers and saturation, which is interesting material, but forms only a small part of model theory and isn't a major focus of active research.
