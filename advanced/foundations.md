# Advanced - Foundations

#### Mac Lane, *Categories for the working mathematician*

Pete Clark isn't convinced that the working mathematician needs any category theory at all, but
I definitely am!  Of course it depends on whether you're interested in something heavily
homological, but most people will need at least the basics of adjoints and limits sometime.
The book covers substantially more than that, but because examples are drawn from some advanced
stuff (rings and Lie algebras appear in the first chapter) you need a fair amount of background
to read it.  Noteworthy is a section near the end entitled "All concepts are Kan extensions".
Most books on homological algebra will contain a brief summary of category theory, as does
Jacobson's *Basic algebra* II; here you can find it laid out in more detail.

#### Jech, *Set Theory*

Spanning several hundred pages, Jech is the standard graduate-level teaching tool and reference text for set theory. Recommended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students planning to conduct research. 

This book has 38 chapters divided into 3 sections: 
  * Basic Set Theory: basics of the axioms, ordinals, cardinals, stationary sets, Boolean algebras, some combinatorial set theory and large cardinals, basic Descriptive set Theory, and basics of models of set theory
  * Advanced Set Theory: The Constructible Universe, Forcing, Iteration Forcing, More on Large Cardinals, Large Cardinals and Inner Model Theory, Descriptive Set Theory
  * Additional Topics

This text takes years to read. Consequently, most newly minted set theory PhDs have not read the entire book. 

I could plausibly recommend the first six chapters to an ambitious undergraduate looking for further study in the foundations of set theory and "basic" cardinal arithmetic; and I first learned about L and first really understood forcing out of chapters 13, 14, and parts of 15 in a senior independent study. 

#### Foreman, Kanamori, et al, *Handbook of Set Theory*

[MR 2768678](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2768678)

A three-volume collection spanning over 2000 pages, this is the de facto reference compendium for modern set theory. 
This text is meant for the professional researcher; I have seen postdocs and above learning out of material in here. I recommend reading this if Jech doesn't provide the depth and complexity desired; this is possible but highly unlikely at the undergraduate level.
