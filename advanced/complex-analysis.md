# Advanced - Complex analysis

#### Andersson, *Topics in complex analysis*

I got through the non-Riemann surfaces part of 314 on this book.  It's a skinny Springer
Universitext which presents complex analysis at a second-course level, efficiently and clearly,
with less talk and fewer commercials.  He starts off by defining *dz = dx + i dy*, which will
annoy some people but makes me happy.  Later chapters treat more advanced analytic material
(Hardy spaces, bounded mean oscillation, and the like).  The exercises are pretty tough.

#### Gunning/Rossi, *Analytic functions of several variables*

This is one of the classic texts on the "real" theory of several complex variables, meaning
analytic spaces, coherent sheaves and the whole bit.  It's a good book so far as it goes, but
there's a lot of hard theory and not a lot of geometric motivation--and no exercises.

#### Whitney, *Complex analytic varieties*

And this is where you go to learn the "fake" theory of several complex variables, meaning what
things actually look like geometrically, with as little machinery as possible.  Very concrete.
I think there's a law that several-complex-variables books must have no exercises and must use
letters as ordinals at some sectioning level.

#### Narasimhan, *Compact Riemann surfaces*

I put this book here to warn that, although Corlette likes to use it as a 314 text, you should
not try to read it until your second or third year of graduate school.  It presents the theory
of compact Riemann surfaces as someone who already knew the general principles would see it, as
a specialization of complex algebraic geometry.

**[Pete Clark]** This book lies on my shelf from Math 314, waiting for someone smarter than me
to come by and read it.  I think I read pages 27 and 28 about 50 times, but that's about it.

#### Jost, *Compact Riemann surfaces*

If you want to know what Riemann surfaces are and why they're interesting, go here instead.
Jost assumes little background; you could probably read this after 207-8-9 with some work.

#### Weyl, *The concept of a Riemann surface*

Or try this book, which is a beautiful classic but uses terminology and ways of thinking which
we consider archaic.  Hassler Whitney is credited with the formal definition of a
differentiable manifold, and Riemann with the idea (in his *Habilitationsschrift*; see Spivak
volume 2 for a translation), but the first edition of this book was a significant step in its
formulation.  Read for culture and brain elevation, once you know some substantial complex
analysis.
