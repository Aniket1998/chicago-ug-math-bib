# Advanced - Probability

#### Feller, *Introduction to probability theory and its applications*

This is the standard text.  It splits into two volumes, namely probability before and after it
turns into measure theory.  What I've read of it is quite well written, and noteworthy for the
great care with which it discusses experimental issues (the idea "what sequence of choices
corresponds to what mathematical construct" can get sticky when dependence relations are
complex).  Some of us will need to know some probability someday, and here it is.  Alternative
references are Shiryaev, *Probability* (Springer, so cheaper and easier to get, but very
Russian) and Billingsley, *Probability and measure* (by a UC emeritus).
