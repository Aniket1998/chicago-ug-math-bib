# Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography

This is an annotated bibliography of books that may be useful to undergraduates in pure
mathematics.  I wrote the original version, with the help of some classmates, during my final
year at the University of Chicago.  To my great surprise, it has been useful to many people
over the intervening years, and I am now maintaining it and accepting contributions on Github.

I am not a "real mathematician", though some of the other contributors to this bibliography
have since gone on to become such.  I'm just some guy; I write software for a living, and try
to understand [homotopy type theory](http://homotopytypetheory.org) when I'm not changing
diapers.  As you read, I ask that you forgive the arrogance and ignorance of a younger me, who
knew everything, and take this resource as it was intended: as a guide that might help another
student find their way.
