# Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography

This is an annotated bibliography of books that may be useful to undergraduates in pure
mathematics.  I wrote the original version, with the help of some classmates, during my final
year (1997-98) at the University of Chicago.  To my great surprise, it has been useful to many
people over the intervening years, and I am now maintaining it and accepting contributions on
Github.

I am not a "real mathematician", though some of the other contributors to this bibliography
have since gone on to become such.  I'm just some guy; I write software for a living, and try
to learn small bits of math in my smaller bits of spare time.  As you read, I ask that you
forgive the arrogance and ignorance of a younger me, who knew everything, and take this
resource as it was intended: as a guide that might help another student find their way.

## Contents

* [School mathematics](school.md): things you could teach to tenth graders, even if they
  usually don't
* [The foundation](foundation.md): the math everyone in _any_ quantitative field should know
* [The first floor](first-floor.md): the core of pure mathematics that every math student needs
  to absorb
* [The patio](patio.md): interesting topics that are accessible without a full "ready for grad
  school" background
* [The garage](garage.md): it's where you keep your wrenches, that is, applied mathematics
* [The second floor](second-floor.md): more advanced treatment of subjects from the first
  floor, or topics that need a broader background to tackle at all
* [The attic](attic.md): if you are up here you probably don't need this bibliography any more

In addition, the original text (as of January 1999) will remain available:
