# Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography

This is an annotated bibliography of books that may be useful to undergraduates in pure
mathematics. I wrote the original version, with the help of some classmates, during my final year
(1997-98) at the University of Chicago. To my great surprise, it has been useful to many people
over the intervening years, and I am now maintaining it and accepting contributions on Github.

I am not a "real mathematician", though some of the other contributors to this bibliography have
since gone on to become such. I'm just some guy; I write software for a living, and try to learn
small bits of math in my smaller bits of spare time. As you read, I ask that you forgive the
arrogance and ignorance of a younger me, who knew everything, and take this resource as it was
intended: as a guide that might help another student find their way.

**Revised 2019**: In this revision I have undertaken three tasks:
* to bring the bibliography up to date by including good books from the past 20 years;
* to improve its coverage in areas (particularly applied areas) where it was formerly weak; and
* to make one or two specific recommendations in each category.

As my ignorance is expanding faster than my knowledge, you will surely find more holes. Please
consider adding your contribution to fill them.

## Contents

* [School mathematics](school.md): things you could teach to tenth graders, even if they
  usually don't
* [The foundation](foundation.md): the math everyone in _any_ quantitative field should know
* [The first floor](first-floor.md): the basic topics math undergrads should know, although not
  everyone will pursue every topic
* [The patio](patio.md): interesting topics that are accessible without a full "ready for grad
  school" background
* [The second floor](second-floor.md): more advanced treatment of subjects from the first floor,
  or topics that need a broader background to tackle at all
* [The attic](attic.md): if you are up here you probably don't need this bibliography any more

In addition, the original text (as of January 1999) will remain available:
